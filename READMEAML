# KhepriThreejs Setup Instructions

## Building the JavaScript Components

Go inside folder Threejs and do:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Accessing the Visualization

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) for security. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8900
```

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: This package is configured to bind to localhost only for security reasons. Do not change this binding unless you understand the security implications.

## Alternative Access (Development Only)

If you need to access from other machines on your network (development only):

1. Check your IP address:
   ```bash
   ipconfig  # Windows
   ifconfig  # Linux/Mac
   ```

2. Extract the IPv4 Address. E.g.:
   ```
   C:\Users\aml>ipconfig
   
   Windows IP Configuration
   ...
   Ethernet adapter Ethernet:
   
      Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
      Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::17c:9c63:8be6:2487%8
      IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.2.79
      Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
      Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.2.1
   ```

Start a browser and go to
```
http://192.168.2.79:8900
```

3. **WARNING**: If you change the binding to allow external access, you must:
   - Understand the security risks
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use firewall rules
   - Only do this in controlled environments

## Development Mode

For development with automatic rebuilding:

```bash
cd Threejs
npm run build:watch
```
